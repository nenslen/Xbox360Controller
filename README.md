# Xbox 360 Controller Tester
A simpler API for interfacing with an xbox 360 controller. This simple interface was made so I could test out my xbox 360 controller on my windows machine. It shows information such as the status, battery level, analog sticks, triggers, buttons, etc. You can also adjust the vibration by changing a slider value.

This is used in another project I started working on that allows the user to use an xbox 360 controller to navigate in google chrome.
